    "text": "Well-being first\nAcademic life can be challenging. We all experience imposter syndrome, overwhelming deadlines, and repeated setbacks. Everything takes ten times longer than we think it will, and there never seems to be an end to the work. However, your health and well-being, both mentally and physically, are more important than your research. Make sure to set aside some time off working hours to do things you enjoy.\nFor example, I love running, biking, CrossFit, cross-country skiing, and hanging out with my loved ones. I also try to have a self-care routine. This looks different for everyone. For me, it’s mindful breathing and reflecting on tiny moments of joy, like the funny little squirrel outside my window, my son’s laugh, or the feel of my cat’s fur. These moments help me remember that, even when the grant isn’t funded, the paper is rejected, and data collection is delayed (again), the things that I love most in this world are still there, and the “bad” things that happen (that sometimes turn out to be good things) don’t change the way the sun feels on my skin, the way the flowers smell, or the the joy I feel on adventure days with my family.\nThat said - even people with great self-care routines sometimes need to talk. If you need to discuss any issues, my door is open. We can work together to adjust goals and come up with plans to help you navigate your situation. My role is to advise and mentor, not evaluate.\n\n\nFlexible hours\nOne of the perks of academic life is flexibility. Everyone has different lifestyles, work habits, and needs for work-life balance. As long as you’re self-motivated and doing your best work, your schedule is your own. However, I expect that you will not take advantage of this flexibility, and that we will make the most of our meetings to collaborate, share ideas, and support each other.\n\n\nMothers and parents in science\nI understand the challenges of balancing childcare and academic responsibilities. Flexibility is key, and our lab supports parents by allowing them to adjust their schedules as needed. However, transparency is important. Please keep me informed of any changes to your availability so we can plan accordingly.\n\n\nVacations\nI encourage you to take advantage of our flexible vacation schedule. Postdoc and staff vacation policies are linked below. For students, I recommend taking at least 3-4 weeks vacation time a year. It is important that we all take time away and detached from this work so we can recharge our batteries. Plan early, inform me when you’ll be away, and ensure your time off doesn’t clash with required coursework. For detailed policies, refer to:\n\nStaff vacation policy\n\nPostdoc vacation policy",

While we maintain respect and professionalism, I acknowledge that academia has centuries of norms that can make people feel excluded. This is a safe space to be yourself.\n\n\nHarassment-free environment\nOur lab is inclusive and welcoming. We do not tolerate discrimination based on race, citizenship, religion, political affiliations, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, pregnancy, appearance, or any other attributes. Microaggressions and hostility have no place here. We all need to be mindful of (and do the work to reduce) our implicit biases. We are united by our passion for science.\n\nCampus policy\n\nCampus and community resources\n\n\n\nValues\nI encourage everyone to assess their values and evaluate whether they are living those values. Some of our lab values include:\n\nObjectivity\nAuthenticity\nCommunication\nStewardship\nTransparency / Trust\nGenerosity",

I do not expect a response from you outside of your typical working schedule. Though there may be occasional exceptions if we are working close to a deadline. In those instances, I will let you know ahead of time the possibility of breaking this expectation.\n\n\nGeneral tips\nClear and respectful communication is key. When you need something, be clear about what, when, and why. Here are some templates to help:\n\nMaking a request: I request that you do X by time Y.\nResponding to a request: (A) Yes, (B) No, or (C) a negotiation.\nMaking a complaint: You agreed to do X by time Y, and you didn’t do it. Here’s how it impacted me. I request that you do X_2 by time Y_2.\nMaking an apology: I agreed to do X by time Y, and I did not do it. Here’s my understanding of how it impacted you. What can I do to make it up?\nGiving feedback: When you do X, I interpret Y, which makes me feel Z. Therefore, I request that you…\n\n\n\nCanceling or rescheduling meetings\nIf you need to reschedule or cancel a meeting, please give 24 hours notice. While this isn’t always feasible, do your best to communicate as promptly as possible.",

    "text": "Research practices and professional development\n\nParticipation\nWhile there are no current plans for regular group lab meetings, we may add these in the future. For any meetings that we do have, active participation is expected.\n\n\nReproducibility\nSharing is essential to our collective growth. Whether it’s writing, methods, or data, we document everything clearly to support each other as researchers. Where relevant, please use LabArchives (Pitt’s electronic lab notebook) to keep detailed records of your work—what worked, what didn’t, and why—so others can build on your efforts. This practice not only upholds scientific rigor but also fosters collaboration and learning within our lab. We aim to share our work openly, from preprints to online repositories, ensuring that our contributions are accessible to the broader community. By lifting each other up, we strengthen our research together.\n\n\nGenerative artificial intelligence (AI)\nI use ChatGPT and other generative AI tools daily, and I’m OK with you using it too. However, I have a few expectations about how it should be used:\n\nBecome AI literate: Take training courses, particularly on ethical use. Develop your own code of conduct outlining when and how you’ll use AI tools.\nDon’t become overly reliant: Use it sparingly. Don’t let it make you lazy—relying too much on AI can be a slippery slope.\nGenerate structure, not content: Feel free to use AI to help with organizing ideas or enhancing communication, but avoid relying on it to draft full content.\nRespect privacy: Never input other people’s writing or personal information into AI tools.\nMaintain objectivity: Remember, you are the human in the loop. Generative AI is often wrong—don’t trust it blindly. Always investigate and fact-check.\nDisclose its use: Be transparent about when you’ve used AI—share what tools you used, for what purpose, and when.\n\n\n\nSelf-enrichment\nStay immersed in the literature. Good ideas often come from reading widely. Attend relevant journal clubs, subscribe to major journal feeds, and set a goal to read at least one interesting paper relevant to your research each week.\n\n\nFellowships and travel grants\nEveryone should look for funding opportunities. PhD students should aim for an F31, and postdocs for a K award. Any BSN students interested in research or research funding – let’s work together to find something for you to apply for! These awards can help you attend conferences, network, and broaden your expertise. I’m here to help with advice on applications.\n\n\nPublish and present\nEveryone is encouraged to publish their findings and present at conferences. Sharing our work with the broader scientific community is crucial for advancing knowledge and building your professional reputation. Whether it’s submitting papers to peer-reviewed journals or giving talks at conferences, these activities are vital components of your academic career. We will support each other in preparing manuscripts, practicing presentations, and navigating the submission process.",

However, in general, you can expect weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly one-on-one or group meetings to discuss research progress, work assignments, and plan next steps. Additional meetings can be scheduled via email as needed.\nGrant and fellowship support: I will assist with brainstorming, writing, and improving postdoctoral or graduate fellowship applications, travel grants, and other grant applications that are related to work being conducted in this lab.\nManuscript and abstract contributions: I will read, comment, edit, and contribute significantly to any abstracts and manuscripts resulting from your research in this lab.\nPresentation practice: We will create opportunities for you to practice talks for conferences or other venues, potentially multiple times. I will also provide feedback on the structure and content of your slides before the practice sessions.\nCareer goals and training plans: We will have discussions about your future career goals and any issues you may face, tailoring your training plans accordingly. These conversations will occur in a safe and confidential space if desired.",
