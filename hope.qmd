* Genome-wide RNA seq data 
* Microbiome data 
* PFAS data

## Eligibility

The study will include mothers who are over 18 years old, at least 35 weeks pregnant, planning to give birth at LBJ Hospital in American Samoa, and intending to reside in American Samoa for at least 6 months post-birth.

## Study Dates

This study is currently in the planning phase.

## Ethics

Ethical approvals are currently under review as part of the study planning.

## Assessments

Trained, bilingual Samoan research assistants will conduct assessments at various time points: before birth, immediately post-birth, and at 2, 4, and 6 months post-birth. Data collection will include sleep patterns, nutrition, behavior, environment, social determinants of health, and physical growth measurements. Biospecimens such as saliva, stool, umbilical cord blood, and capillary blood will also be collected.
