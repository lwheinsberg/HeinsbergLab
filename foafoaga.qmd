# The Foafoaga o le Ola Study {.unnumbered}

**Beginning of Life**

## Overview

This longitudinal, observational study of mother-infant dyads aimed to identify factors in pregnancy and the early postpartum period that contribute to non-communicable diseases in Samoa.

## Genomic data 

* CREBRF rs373863828
* Untargeted metabolomic data
* PFAS data

## Eligibility

Eligible mothers were over 18 years old, between 35-41 weeks gestation, with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies. They planned to give birth at TTM Hospital and lived within 30 minutes of Apia for ease of follow-up.

## Study Dates

2017-2019

## Ethics

Informed consent was obtained from all mothers. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at Yale University, the University of Pittsburgh, and the Health Research Committee of Samoa.

## Assessments

Bilingual Samoan research assistants conducted assessments of the mother-infant dyads at 1 week, 2 months, and 4 months post-birth. Some infants were reassessed at 24 months post-birth. Data on behavior, environment, physical measurements, and biospecimens (saliva, dried blood spots) were collected for later analysis.
