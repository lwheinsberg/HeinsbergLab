# The EETR Study {.unnumbered}

**E**pigenetic **E**ffects on Pediatric **T**raumatic Brain Injury **R**ecovery

## Overview

EETR is an observational, prospective, longitudinal concurrent cohort study of children aged 3-18 years with either TBI or orthopedic injury, recruited from the UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Participants complete study visits acutely and at 6 and 12 months post-injury. 

## Genomic data 

* BDNF DNA methylation 
* Genome-wide DNA methylation 
* BDNF expression data

## Eligibility

Children aged 3-18 years with either TBI or orthopedic injury and no history of neurological disorder. 

## Study Dates

2017 - present

## Ethics

The study received ethics approval from the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board. Participants and their parents provide informed consent/assent.

## Assessments

EETR data collection is conducted at three time points: acute (prior to hospital discharge) and chronic (at 6 and 12 months post-injury) during outpatient follow-up visits at CHP. Extensive phenotypic data collection broadly included hypothesized predictors of neurobehavioral recovery, neurobehavioral outcomes, and potential confounders/covariates related to epignetics or neurobehvaioral recovery.
